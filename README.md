#PokemonBattle

Created a nostalgic, mini text-based game for the first Pokemon battle a player would have in either the Kanto or Johto Region. The player is able to determine their own name and their opponent's name, as well as decide which starter pokemon they would like to take into battle.
This text-based game uses Java, incorporating OOP, and CLI. The game takes into account the type strength and weaknesses as well as other stats like HP, attack, defencse, speed, etc.
Enjoy!
